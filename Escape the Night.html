	<h1> Welcome to Escape the Night! </h1>

<h3> Our team, Dust Bunnies 0.25, wanted to make a game that would teach about street safety when going out. We didn't have much prior programming knowledge so we decided to create a text-based/choose your own adventure game in python, which we had learned from the learnathon. A couple of our members also knew some html from a class in school, so we created this webpage to explain and spread more awareness about safety measures people should take when going out and dangers that might arise.</h3>

<h2> Kidnappings </h2>
<p>The example in our game that we included was the baby crying method. Sometimes kidnappers would play tapes of babies crying to lure in bypassers, so when they go to investigate, they get taken. We suggest to travel in numbers and examine the environment before taking action.  </p>


<h2> Robberies </h2>
<p>To lower the chances of being robbed, we suggest that you should be as prepared as possible. In our game, we set up a situation in which bringing your phone and portable charger was the most optimal option to prevent being separated from your group; however if you don't bring your devices, you become lost from the rest of your friends. This would make you an easier target for potential thieves. </p>



<h2> Stay Safe </h2>
<p> We made this game to simulate real life events that could lead to kidnappings, robberies, or other dangerous acts. We understand that these acts are serious problems in our societies, and that the majority of people are unprepared for sudden events such as these. Our game was created to not only spread awareness, but to also offer ideas on how to better protect oneself when going out. </p>
