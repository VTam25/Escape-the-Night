	<h1> Welcome to Escape the Night! <h1>

<h3> Our team, Dust Bunnies 0.25, wanted to make a game that would teach about safety when going out. We didn't have much prior programming knowledge so we decided to create a text-based/choose your own adventure game in python, which we had learned from the learnathon. A couple of our members also knew some html from a class in school, so we created this webpage to explain and spread more awareness about safety measures people should take when going out and dangers that might arise. </h3>
